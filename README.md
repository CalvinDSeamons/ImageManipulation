Image Manipulation Lab. 

This project uses no built in libraries for image processing. All calculations are done by looping through the pixels. 
Functions are as follows: Rotation, Edge Detection, Color Finder, Equalizer, Histogram Readout of RGB, Gray Scale,
Gaussian Blur. 


Note: Sorry for the indentation/format. This code has been through 6+ IDE's so it looks atrocious. All that is left
working on my laptop is good ol' Vi and I'm not about to format a java file with it.
